Project 3 ideas

Company idea Generation platform
Core Features (MVP - Minimum Viable Product):

3 models:
User model
Idea model (form) —> create
Likes/voting model
Comments model

* User Authentication: Users can register (username, email, password) and log in/out.  JWT (JSON Web Tokens) should be used for secure authentication.   
* Post Creation: Authenticated users can create short posts (think Twitter's character limit). Posts should have content, a timestamp, and the author (user).
* Post Viewing: All users (or potentially  just logged-in users, depending on your design) can view posts. Posts should be displayed in reverse chronological order (newest first).
* Post Deletion (by author): Users can delete their own posts.
